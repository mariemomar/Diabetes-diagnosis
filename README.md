# ðŸ©º Diabetes Diagnosis using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical features (e.g., glucose, BMI, age).  
It uses **multiple machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, SVM with Linear Kernel, and SVM with RBF Kernel), and applies a **majority voting** system to decide the final outcome.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocesses the dataset with **StandardScaler** for normalization.  
- Trains three ML models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (Linear Kernel)  
  - Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)  
- Saves models and scaler with **joblib** for reuse.  
- Accepts user input for prediction.  
- Applies **majority voting** to combine model outputs.
